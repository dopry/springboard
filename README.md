# Springboard

Springboard is a collection of web developer focused vagrant baseboxes. Springboard base boxes provide python, nodejs, and php languages. The boxes use ansible for configuration, are regularly updates, and provide a number of other small conveniences. Springboard Boxes are designed to minimize the amount of time between a vagrant destroy and a vagrant up.  

This repository contains:

* /packer - packer definitions for boxes. 
* /ansible - ansible playbooks and roles for setting up an environment.
* /bootstrap.sh
* /Vagrantfile - Example vagrant file for all boxes

You can use packer to build the VM's yourself or you can use the images hosted on [Vagrant Cloud](http://vagrantcloud.com).

## Contributing

Springboard needs you! We want your feedback and pull requests. Springboard is driven by a few core concepts.

* Use distribution packages for features where possible.
* Remove unnecessary packages where it doesn't hamper the development experience.
* Add features that reduce the work and time necessary for development.
* Vagrants should be re-usable both for CI and production.
